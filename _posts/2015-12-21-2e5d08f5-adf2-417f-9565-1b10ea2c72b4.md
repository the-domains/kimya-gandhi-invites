Its a simple design that brings out Aniruddha's deep liking for traditional arts in India. The front cover of the invite is an illustration of Radha- Krishna in contemporary Madhubani style. The colours are bright and the lines simple. There is careful detailing yet the edges are rough. The envelope is made of a muted beige and gold screen print.
